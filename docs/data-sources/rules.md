Fetches the list of event rules.



<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Required to use the test framework. Just a placeholder.
- `rules` (Attributes List) List of event rules. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--rules))

<a id="nestedatt--rules"></a>
### Nested Schema for `rules`

Read-Only:

- `actions` (Attributes List) List of actions to execute. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--rules--actions))
- `conditions` (Attributes) Defines the conditions that trigger the rule. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--rules--conditions))
- `created_at` (Number) Creation time as unix timestamp in milliseconds.
- `description` (String) Optional description.
- `id` (String)
- `name` (String) Unique name.
- `status` (Number) 1 enabled, 0 disabled.
- `trigger` (Number) Event trigger. 1 = Filesystem event, 2 = Provider event, 3 = Schedule, 4 = IP Blocked, 5 = Certificate renewal, 6 = On demand, 7 = Identity Provider login.
- `updated_at` (Number) Last update time as unix timestamp in milliseconds.

<a id="nestedatt--rules--actions"></a>
### Nested Schema for `rules.actions`

Read-Only:

- `execute_sync` (Boolean) Supported for upload events and required for pre-* events and Identity provider login events if the action checks the account.
- `is_failure_action` (Boolean)
- `name` (String)
- `stop_on_failure` (Boolean)


<a id="nestedatt--rules--conditions"></a>
### Nested Schema for `rules.conditions`

Read-Only:

- `fs_events` (List of String) Filesystem events that trigger the rule. Supported values: "upload", "pre-upload", "first-upload", "download", "pre-download", "first-download", "delete", "pre-delete", "rename", "mkdir", "rmdir", "copy", "ssh_cmd"
- `idp_login_event` (Number) Identity Provider login event that trigger the rule. 0 any, 1 user, 2 admin.
- `options` (Attributes) Options for event conditions. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--rules--conditions--options))
- `provider_events` (List of String) Provider events that trigger the rule. Supported values: "add", "update", "delete".
- `schedules` (Attributes List) List of schedules that trigger the rule. Hours: 0-23. Day of week: 0-6 (Sun-Sat). Day of month: 1-31. Month: 1-12. Asterisk (*) indicates a match for all the values of the field. e.g. every day of week, every day of month and so on. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--rules--conditions--schedules))

### Nested Schema for `rules.conditions.options`

Read-Only:

- `concurrent_execution` (Boolean) If enabled, allow to execute scheduled tasks concurrently from multiple SFTPGo instances.
