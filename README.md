This provider is a bridge between Terraform and the [SFTPGo](https://github.com/drakkan/sftpgo) API.

You can find some usage examples [here](./examples).

Please note that this provider is experimental, I'm not happy with its code, if you have experience using the [terraform-plugin-framework](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework) any help to improve the provider is appreciated. Thank you.
