Terraform Registry: [https://registry.terraform.io/providers/drakkan/sftpgo](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/drakkan/sftpgo)

This provider is a bridge between Terraform and the [SFTPGo](https://github.com/drakkan/sftpgo) API.
Terraform objects have slightly different structures than the ones defined in the SFTPGo REST API, refer to the documentation for more details.

You can find some [usage examples here](./examples).

This provider supports both the Open Source and Enterprise editions of SFTPGo.
